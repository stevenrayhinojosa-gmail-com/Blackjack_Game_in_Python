# Blackjack Game in Python
Deck Representation:

The game simulates a standard deck of playing cards. Each card has a rank (2 to 10, J, Q, K, A) and a suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). The deck is often represented as a collection of cards.
Player and Dealer Hands:

Players and the dealer are dealt hands from the deck. A hand is a collection of cards. In Blackjack, each player typically starts with two cards.
Card Values:

Each card has a numerical value in Blackjack. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on the hand's context.
Player Input:

The game allows players to make decisions, such as hitting (taking another card) or standing (keeping the current hand). Some versions may include additional options like doubling down or splitting pairs.
Dealer's Turn:

The dealer follows a set of rules for their turn. Usually, they must hit until their hand reaches a certain value (e.g., 17). The dealer's actions are automated and not influenced by player decisions.
Winning Conditions:

The game checks for winning conditions after each player's turn and the dealer's turn. A player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21. Alternatively, a player can win by having the dealer bust (exceed 21).
Tie and Push:

If a player and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a tie, often referred to as a "push." In most cases, the player's bet is returned.
Blackjack (Natural 21):

A special case occurs when a player or the dealer is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card initially. This is called a "Blackjack" or "Natural 21" and usually results in a higher payout.
Betting:

Players may have a betting system where they place bets at the beginning of each round. Winning a hand typically results in a payout based on the bet.
Game Loop:

The entire game logic is encapsulated within a main game loop. The loop continues until players decide to exit the game or until a predetermined number of rounds have been played.
End of Game Message:

After each round, there's a display message indicating the outcome, such as who won, lost, or if it's a tie. This provides feedback to the players and communicates the result of the round.
